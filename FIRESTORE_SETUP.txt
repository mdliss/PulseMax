FIREBASE REALTIME SETUP - IMPORTANT!

The dashboard now uses Firebase Realtime Listeners instead of SSE.
This means data streams directly from Firestore to the browser - NO disconnects!

DEPLOYMENT STEPS:

1. Deploy Firestore Security Rules:

   cd /Users/max/PulseMax
   firebase deploy --only firestore:rules

   (Make sure you have Firebase CLI installed: npm install -g firebase-cli)

2. Verify Firebase Environment Variables:

   Make sure these are set in Vercel:
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID
   - NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID

3. Security Considerations:

   Current rules allow PUBLIC READ access to sessions and tutors collections.
   This is OK for a dashboard, but consider adding authentication:

   // Example: Require authentication
   allow read: if request.auth != null;

   // Example: Require specific user
   allow read: if request.auth.uid == "your-admin-uid";

4. Test Locally First:

   npm run dev

   Open http://localhost:3000/dashboard
   Watch console for Firebase connection messages

5. Deploy:

   vercel --prod

   The dashboard will now have zero disconnects and instant updates!

WHAT CHANGED:

✅ Removed SSE endpoint (no more serverless timeout issues)
✅ Direct Firebase connection from browser
✅ Automatic reconnection on network issues
✅ Real-time updates with zero delay
✅ Works on Vercel free plan

MONITORING:

- Green dot = Connected to Firebase
- Data updates in real-time as Firestore changes
- Check browser console for any Firebase errors
