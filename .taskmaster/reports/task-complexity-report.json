			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Integrate Real-Time Updates with SSE",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify key components for SSE integration, including server setup, client-side implementation, and testing strategies.",
			"reasoning": "Integrating Server-Sent Events (SSE) involves handling real-time data flow, which can be complex due to the need for efficient data management and low latency. Dependencies on existing services add to the complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Develop API Endpoints for Data Access",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the API development into defining routes, implementing business logic, handling authentication, and testing endpoints.",
			"reasoning": "Creating RESTful API endpoints requires careful planning around data access patterns, security, and performance. The task's dependencies also necessitate coordination with other components."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 14,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Redis Caching for Performance",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps for setting up Redis, integrating it with existing data access layers, and testing cache performance.",
			"reasoning": "While implementing caching can improve performance significantly, it requires understanding of data access patterns and potential pitfalls like cache invalidation, making it moderately complex."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Deploy Application on Vercel",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the deployment process, including environment variable configuration and post-deployment testing.",
			"reasoning": "Deployment processes are generally straightforward but require attention to detail, especially concerning environment configurations and ensuring all dependencies are correctly set up."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Export Functionality for Customer Data",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify the steps for implementing the export feature, including data retrieval and CSV formatting.",
			"reasoning": "Exporting data to CSV is a common task with established patterns, making it relatively simple. However, considerations for data integrity and performance with large datasets are necessary."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Responsive Design for Mobile",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the tasks for implementing responsive design, including layout adjustments and testing across devices.",
			"reasoning": "Responsive design requires a good understanding of CSS and layout principles. While not overly complex, it does involve testing across multiple devices to ensure usability."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Set Up Monitoring and Logging with Sentry",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Detail the integration steps for Sentry, including configuration for error tracking and alert setup.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up monitoring and logging involves integrating third-party services and ensuring that error tracking is comprehensive, which adds a layer of complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Optimize Database Queries for Performance",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the optimization process into analyzing current queries, implementing changes, and testing performance improvements.",
			"reasoning": "Optimizing database queries requires a deep understanding of SQL and database performance, making it moderately complex. The need for thorough testing adds to the task's complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Implement User Feedback Mechanism",
			"complexityScore": 3,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 2,
			"expansionPrompt": "Identify the steps for creating the feedback form and setting up data storage.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a feedback mechanism is straightforward, involving form creation and data storage. The complexity is low due to established patterns for such features."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 24,
			"taskTitle": "Conduct Usability Testing",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Outline the steps for planning usability tests, conducting sessions, and analyzing feedback.",
			"reasoning": "Usability testing requires careful planning and execution to gather meaningful insights, making it moderately complex due to the need for user interaction and analysis."
