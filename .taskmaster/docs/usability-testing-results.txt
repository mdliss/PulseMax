Scenario 6: 9.8 min vs 8 min expert = 123% ⚠ ABOVE TARGET
Scenario 7: 11.2 min vs 6 min expert = 187% ❌ ABOVE TARGET
Scenario 8: 6.7 min vs 4 min expert = 168% ⚠ ABOVE TARGET

Overall Average: 11 min vs 7.1 min expert = 155% ❌ ABOVE TARGET

Analysis: Users take significantly longer than expert users across all scenarios.
Primary causes: Navigation confusion, unclear UI affordances, slow loading times.

==================================================
RECOMMENDED PRIORITIZATION
==================================================

SPRINT 1 (Week 1-2) - Critical Fixes:
1. Redesign alert icon with prominent placement and notification badge
2. Fix mobile phone responsiveness (larger touch targets, better scaling)
3. Redesign date picker for supply-demand forecasting
4. Make logo clickable to return to dashboard
5. Implement loading skeletons for slow API calls

SPRINT 2 (Week 3-4) - High Priority:
1. Standardize export button placement across all features
2. Add notification system (email alerts at minimum)
3. Implement alert management (acknowledge, dismiss, view history)
4. Add prediction model transparency (methodology, confidence, accuracy)
5. Improve mobile header design with visible alert icon

SPRINT 3 (Week 5-6) - Medium Priority:
1. Add breadcrumb navigation
2. Implement dashboard customization
3. Make date range selector more prominent
4. Add search/command palette for navigation
5. Standardize navigation patterns across features

SPRINT 4 (Week 7-8) - Low Priority & Polish:
1. Add keyboard shortcuts
2. Make metric cards interactive/clickable
3. Implement scenario planning for forecasts
4. Add mobile card view for tables
5. Implement auto-hide navigation on scroll

==================================================
FOLLOW-UP TESTING PLAN
==================================================

After Sprint 1-2 fixes, conduct targeted re-testing:
- Re-test Scenario 4 (Alert System) with 5 participants - Target: >85% completion
- Re-test Scenario 7 (Mobile) with 3 phone users - Target: >85% completion
- Re-test Scenario 2 (Forecasting) with 3 participants - Target: >85% completion

Success Criteria for Follow-Up:
- Alert scenario completion rate improves from 56% to >85%
- Mobile scenario completion rate improves from 67% to >85%
- Time-on-task decreases by at least 20% across all scenarios
- SUS score improves from 72.3 to >75
- Zero P0 issues remaining

Continuous Monitoring:
- Implement analytics tracking for navigation paths
- Track export button usage rates
- Monitor alert engagement rates
- Measure time-to-insight on dashboard
- Survey new users monthly for onboarding feedback

==================================================
CONCLUSION
==================================================

The PulseMax Analytics Dashboard shows strong potential with above-average usability scores (SUS: 72.3) and positive user reception (NPS: 38). Users particularly value the Tutor Performance and Churn Prediction features, praising the clean design and actionable insights.

However, three critical issues must be addressed immediately:
1. Alert system visibility causing 44% miss rate
2. Mobile phone experience requiring constant pinch-zoom
3. Confusing date picker causing 25% task failures

Addressing these P0 issues, followed by high-priority navigation and export improvements, will significantly improve user experience and task completion rates. The recommended sprint plan provides a clear path forward to achieve >85% task completion rates and >75 SUS scores.

User feedback suggests the platform is on the right track but needs UX refinement to reach its full potential. The team should prioritize fixes that reduce friction in core workflows, improve mobile experience, and enhance the visibility of critical features like alerts.

With these improvements implemented, PulseMax is well-positioned to become a highly usable and valuable analytics tool for the education technology sector.
